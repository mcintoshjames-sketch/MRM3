## Regression Testing Workflow

### Before Adding New Features
1. Run full test suite to ensure baseline passes
2. Document new feature requirements
3. Add test cases for new functionality (TDD approach preferred)

### After Adding New Features
1. Write/update tests for new functionality
2. Run full regression suite
3. Update this document with new test coverage
4. Commit tests alongside feature code

### Before Each PR/Commit
```bash
# Quick validation (full regression suite)
cd api && python -m pytest -x  # Stop on first failure
cd web && pnpm test:run        # Frontend tests
```

## Test Infrastructure

### Backend (pytest)
- **Location**: `api/tests/`
- **Config**: `api/pytest.ini`
- **Fixtures**: `api/tests/conftest.py`
- **Database**: In-memory SQLite for isolation
- **Key fixtures**:
  - `client` - Test HTTP client
  - `db_session` - Fresh database per test
  - `test_user` / `admin_user` - Pre-created users
  - `auth_headers` / `admin_headers` - JWT auth headers
  - `sample_model` - Pre-created model

### Frontend (vitest + React Testing Library)
- **Location**: `web/src/**/*.test.tsx`
- **Config**: `web/vite.config.ts`
- **Setup**: `web/src/test/setup.ts` (localStorage mock)
- **Utils**: `web/src/test/utils.tsx` (custom render with BrowserRouter)
- **Environment**: happy-dom (avoids jsdom localStorage issues)
- **Mocking Strategy**: Direct module mocking with vi.mock() - no MSW
  - Mock AuthContext for auth state
  - Mock api/client for API calls
- **Key patterns**:
  - Mock `../contexts/AuthContext` to control useAuth()
  - Mock `../api/client` to control API responses
  - Use vi.fn() for tracking function calls

## Adding Tests for New Features

### Backend Example
```python
# api/tests/test_new_feature.py
import pytest

class TestNewFeature:
    def test_feature_success(self, client, auth_headers):
        response = client.post("/new-endpoint", headers=auth_headers, json={...})
        assert response.status_code == 200
```

### Frontend Example
```tsx
// web/src/pages/NewPage.test.tsx
import { describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '../test/utils';
import NewPage from './NewPage';

// Mock dependencies at module level
const mockApiGet = vi.fn();
vi.mock('../api/client', () => ({
    default: { get: (...args: any[]) => mockApiGet(...args) }
}));

vi.mock('../contexts/AuthContext', () => ({
    useAuth: () => ({
        user: { user_id: 1, email: 'test@example.com', full_name: 'Test', role: 'user' },
        login: vi.fn(),
        logout: vi.fn(),
        loading: false,
    }),
}));

describe('NewPage', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
        mockApiGet.mockReset();
    });

    it('renders correctly', async () => {
        mockApiGet.mockResolvedValueOnce({ data: [] });
        render(<NewPage />);
        await waitFor(() => {
            expect(screen.getByText('Expected Text')).toBeInTheDocument();
        });
    });
});
```

- [x] Deployed regions: ANY overlap triggers rule
- [x] Deployed regions: no overlap does not trigger rule
- [x] Existing approval prevents duplicate requirement creation

#### Approval Workflow Integration (4/8 tests passing, 4 require validation workflow hooks)
- [⚠️] Rule evaluation on validation request creation (needs workflow integration hook)
- [⚠️] Rule re-evaluation when moving to Pending Approval status (needs workflow integration hook)
- [⚠️] Submit conditional approval as Admin with evidence (needs workflow integration hook)
- [⚠️] Submit approval updates Model.use_approval_date when all complete (needs workflow integration hook)
- [x] Submit conditional approval as non-Admin fails (403)
- [x] Void approval requirement with reason
- [x] Void approval creates audit log (CONDITIONAL_APPROVAL_VOID)
- [x] Submit approval creates audit log (CONDITIONAL_APPROVAL_SUBMIT)

**Note**: The 4 failing integration tests require the validation workflow API to call conditional approval evaluation at specific lifecycle points:
1. Auto-evaluate rules when ValidationRequest is created via POST /validation-workflow/requests/
2. Re-evaluate rules when ValidationRequest status transitions to "Pending Approval"
3. These hooks need to be added to validation_workflow.py endpoints
